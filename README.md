# Apprenticeship Completion Risk Modelling

## Overview

This project predicts whether an apprentice is likely to overrun their expected completion timeline using early engagement and learner data.
The goal is to enable early intervention and improve completion outcomes.

## Approach
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Feature engineering from early engagement metrics
* Scikit-learn Pipelines with ColumnTransformer
* Train/test split with cross-validation

## Evaluation
Metrics used:
* ROC-AUC
* Precision/Recall
* F1 Score
* Confusion Matrix

## Tech Stack
* Python
* Pandas & NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository. 
2. Create virtual environment.
3. Install [requirements](requirements.txt).
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run [script](Learner-Completion-Modelling.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
